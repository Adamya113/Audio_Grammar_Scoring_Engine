# Overview
The objective of this competition is to develop a Grammar Scoring Engine for spoken data samples. We are provided with an audio dataset where each file is between 45 to 60 seconds long. The ground truth labels are MOS Likert Grammar Scores for each audio instance. The task is to build a model that takes an audio file as input and outputs a continuous score ranging from 0 to 5.

# Dataset
-    Training: The training dataset consists of 444 samples. 
-    Testing (Evaluation): The testing dataset consists of 195 samples. 
-    *The dataset is private, and held by SHL*
